### Token Utility
- **Collateral for Loans:** TRS tokens can be staked as collateral to secure property-backed loans.
- **Interest Payments:** Lenders receive interest payments in TRS tokens, incentivizing lending activity.

### Vesting Schedule
- **Team & Founders:** 25% released after 1 year, with the remaining 75% released linearly over the next 3 years.
- **Advisors & Partnerships:** Linear vesting over 2 years, ensuring long-term alignment with the project.

### Staking Rewards
- **Yield Farming:** TRS holders can stake their tokens to earn additional TRS or other partnered tokens.
- **Property Ownership Yield:** Token holders who own fractionalized property tokens can earn rental income in TRS.
