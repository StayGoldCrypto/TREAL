Here's a breakdown of the import statements you've provided:

import { useAccount, useApi } from "@gear-js/react-hooks";:

useAccount: A hook from the @gear-js/react-hooks library that provides interaction with the Polkadot-js extension API, allowing you to manage accounts and sign transactions.
useApi: A hook that provides access to the Vara API connected to the selected RPC-node.
import { ApiLoader } from "@/components";:

ApiLoader: A component likely used to display a loading state while the API is initializing or fetching data. The exact functionality would depend on its implementation in your project.
import { Header } from "@/components/layout";:

Header: A component that is part of the layout, probably used to display the top section of your application, such as navigation or branding.
import { withProviders } from "@/app/hocs";:

withProviders: A higher-order component (HOC) that wraps your application with necessary providers, such as context providers for state management or theming.
import { useWalletSync } from "@/features/wallet/hooks";:

useWalletSync: A custom hook that likely synchronizes wallet data or state with your application. The exact functionality would depend on its implementation.
import { Routing } from "./pages";:

Routing: A component or function that handles the routing logic of your application, defining how different pages are accessed and displayed.
import { useInitSails } from "./app/hooks";:

useInitSails: A custom hook that likely initializes certain features or state related to "sails" in your application. The exact functionality would depend on its implementation.
import { CONTRACT_DATA, sponsorName, sponsorMnemonic } from "./app/consts";:

CONTRACT_DATA, sponsorName, sponsorMnemonic: Constants that are imported from your application's constants file. These might include configuration data, such as contract addresses or sponsor information.
import "@gear-js/vara-ui/dist/style.css";:

This imports the CSS styles from the @gear-js/vara-ui package, applying the default styles provided by the library to your application.
These imports collectively set up various hooks, components, and styles necessary for your application's functionality and appearance.
